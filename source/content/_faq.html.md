### Is this a game?

No. These are more in the tradition of sports trading cards. The backs of the cards feature information like website, creators, license etc.

### Where will the deck be sold?

Via my etsy account and wherever I personally attend.

### How many cards are you making and what types of cards?

I will do an initial artsy series of 6 handmade and sealed booster packs á 7 cards. Each pack also features a blank card to document your own project. 

Secondly, there are cards for conferences or barcamps and the like, where the Maker's Deck is somehow "attending". One meter of desk or on the wall does it, it's not primarily a point of sale but a micro exhibition.

### Who else has agreed to be in it?

This is the first half of the inital 42 I locked on Oct 5th:

### When is this happening?

Right now. The Kickstarter campaign will not go before 2013.

### How much are you selling the cards for?

The packs are €25 each. No, I don't expect anybody to buy them at this price, which is the point. If you are interested in owning original pieces of art, grab it while it's hot. 

Otherwise, wait for the first complete deck.
